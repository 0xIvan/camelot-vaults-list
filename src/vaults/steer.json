      "description": "The High Low Channel Strategy is a sophisticated LP approach that utilizes the Donchian channel as its foundation. By considering the highest high and the lowest low over a designated period, this strategy forms a robust price channel. An optional multiplier can be applied to widen the channel, offering more flexibility and potential to capitalize on larger price movements. With this strategy, LPs can dynamically adapt to market volatility and position themselves advantageously within the evolving price landscape."
